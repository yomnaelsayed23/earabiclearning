                            The Intensive program needs to be taken within a week's time: 5 consecutive days. Each
                            lesson is followed with 1 hour of homework. <br>
                            With the Regular lesson, you can take the lessons at your own pace (1 or more lessons per
                            week, skip a week if needed...) and there is a bit more homework assigned (usually 1h30).

                            If you need to postpone an already scheduled lesson, you need to send a message to your
                            teacher at least 24 hours before the scheduled lesson. The class can then be postponed to a
                            later date. </div>

                            We don't typically use a webcam unless a child or an adult beginner is taking the lesson. We
                            have noticed that students often have the tendency to focus more on the sounds of the
                            language without the webcam. With the chat board, you will have some visual aid. It is more
                            effective to concentrate on listening comprehension and gain a comfort level with
                            recognizing the sounds. Nevertheless, if a student prefers to use the webcam, the teacher
                            will be happy to turn it on. </div>

                        </h3>

                            The cost of living in Egypt can vary greatly depending on your lifestyle and location.
                            However, in general, it is considered to be relatively low compared to many other countries.
                            According to Numbeo's cost of living index, the average cost of living for a single person
                            in Cairo, Egypt is around $450 to $650 per month. This includes expenses such as housing,
                            food, transportation, and entertainment.<br>
                            <br>
                            If you're trying to live on a budget, you can get by with even less. However, if you're
                            looking to live a more comfortable lifestyle with more luxury items and activities, you may
                            need to spend more.<br>
                            <br>
                            It's also worth noting that prices can vary significantly depending on where you live and
                            shop. For example, living in central Cairo will likely be more expensive than living in a
                            smaller city or town. Similarly, eating out at upscale restaurants or staying in high-end
                            hotels will cost more than eating at local street food stalls or staying in budget
                            accommodations.<br>
                            <br>
                            It's also important to consider other expenses, such as healthcare, insurance, and education
                            if you have children, as well as other personal expenses such as clothing, internet, and
                            phone plans.<br>

                            According to the ACTFL (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages) Proficiency
                            Guidelines, it typically takes approximately 2200 hours of study for an English speaker to
                            reach an Advanced level of proficiency in Arabic.<br>
                            <br>
                            However, it's important to note that the amount of time it takes to learn Arabic will depend
                            on various factors, including your prior language learning experience, your exposure to the
                            language, the intensity of your study, and your individual learning style. Some learners may
                            take longer to achieve proficiency, while others may progress more quickly.<br>
                            <br>
                            Additionally, it's important to remember that language learning is a continuous process and
                            requires ongoing practice and study. Even after reaching an advanced level of proficiency,
                            learners need to continue practicing and expanding their skills to maintain and improve
                            their language&nbsp;abilities<br>
                            <br>
                            In addition to the approximate time frame provided by the ACTFL, it's also worth noting that
                            there are many resources available to help you learn Arabic, including language learning
                            academies . eArabicLearning Academy offers a free estimate meeting to assess your current

                            exactly where you are and make the most efficient progress towards achieving your language

                        <div class="toggle_content boxed" style="display: none;">
                            The number of levels in Arabic can vary depending on the curriculum and program you are
                            following, but generally, there are 6 main levels of proficiency in Arabic:<br>
                            <br>
                            Novice Low<br>
                            Novice Mid<br>
                            Novice High<br>
                            Intermediate Low<br>
                            Intermediate Mid<br>
                            Intermediate High<br>
                            The time it takes to complete each level will depend on a number of factors, including the
                            intensity and frequency of your study, your prior language learning experience, and your
                            individual learning style. Generally, a typical Arabic course at a university or language
                            center can take between 4-6 months per level, with each level consisting of around 120-150
                            hours of study. However, this can vary widely depending on the program and the learner's
                            individual circumstances.<br>
                            It's worth noting that after reaching an intermediate level, the progression to advanced
                            levels of proficiency may take longer and require more focused and intensive study.
                            Additionally, the ACTFL proficiency levels mentioned earlier are generally used as a guide
                            to measure proficiency, but different programs and organizations may have their own criteria
                            for determining proficiency&nbsp;levels.<br>
