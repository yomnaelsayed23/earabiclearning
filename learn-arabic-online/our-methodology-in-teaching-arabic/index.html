                        <h2>Classroom management</h2>
                        <p>Classroom management is indeed one of the most important premises to teaching. If the teacher
                            is capable of carrying it out successfully, this will yield the best learning outcomes.
                            Classroom management comprises two fundamental aspects.</p>
                        <p><strong>First, there is lesson planning</strong>. This includes the objectives to be achieved
                            in each lesson and the teaching strategy, which is determined by the students’ disposition
                            and their level. At the same time, it is of paramount importance, to ensure the achievement
                            of the learning objectives, to carefully plan a subdivision of the classroom time from its
                            very start to its closure.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Secondly, there is the actual carrying out of the class</strong>; which must be
                            tailored according to the type of class we have and based on the students' needs. We begin
                            with student placement according to their level and proceed with a clear strategy of how the
                            class will run from beginning to end. In particular, we pay special attention to the two
                            aspects of supervising the development of each class and to ensure an orderly sequence of
                            activities and the question and answer in class. Finally, we close with clear remarks,
                            proportionate to the duration of the overall class. These should ensure that the key
                            concepts remain with the students.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"
                                style="text-align: center;"></p>
                        <p>We generally prefer to use critical strategies that allow students to immerse themselves in
                            each learning activity, allowing them to interact with and participate in the learning
                            process. Such “<strong>full immersion strategies</strong>” imply minimizing the theoretical
                            aspect of classroom instruction and to focus instead on hands-on learning. Students are
                            constantly active as protagonists in each learning activity. They are the protagonist who
                            conveys the information to their classmates.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"
                                style="text-align: center;"></p>
                        <p>One example of how we used these strategies in the past is as follows. In one of our classes,
                            We had a mix of students of various nationalities: French, Canadian, British, Americans and
                            Russians. We required that they use only Arabic for their classroom interactions. We made
                            sure that each small group included students from all nationalities. Initially, this
                            arrangement was hard on the students, particularly because of cultural differences, but they
                            quickly got accustomed to these, thanks to the activities that was planned for them: Russian
                            students interacted and collaborated with the French ones in role-playing and in reading
                            activities.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"
                                style="text-align: center;"></p>
                        <p>Another example from our experience.&nbsp; We had, for example, language instruction through
                            cooking lessons: the students prepared an Iftar for the month of Ramadan, using Arabic in
                            the process. We led the students through the streets of the Alexandria, Egypt market, where
                            we collected the ingredients needed for our recipes: fruit, vegetables, etc… We took
                            everything back to the school and there the students recreated the market in the halls and
                            corridors. Some students played the sellers and others the customers, carrying out their
                            conversations&nbsp; using only Arabic. Subsequently, students helped each other in preparing
                            the recipes we had chosen without using a word other than in Arabic.</p>
                        <p>The ‘<strong>fine box</strong>’ for students who used foreign words. In the end, American,
                            British and Belgian students were all helping each other setting the table and presenting to
                            their classmates the different plates available, using only Arabic.</p>
                        <p>This is an example of a collaborative class from beginning to end: from the cooking class to
                            the market experience, where students learned names of fruits, vegetable, and spices, bought
                            and sold using numbers. All these aspects were mixed in one main activity, which we prepared
                            over the course of various days, rehearsing it and fine-tuning it with the students. This
                            required a certain effort, but the results of this class were enormous and proven super
                            effective in acquiring new words and holding a conversation with native speakers with ease.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"
                                style="text-align: center;"></p>
                        <h2>Curriculum Development</h2>
                        <p>The first step towards developing an effective teaching strategy is to know the students and
                            to understand their specific needs, which are related to their age and their inclinations
                            towards this or that teaching method or program. When the teacher owns these keys, he will
                            be without a doubt successful in his work. Hence, it is of paramount importance that before
                            building a curriculum, the teacher leads an exploratory session to fully understand the
                            inclinations, needs, wishes and linguistic level of the students. Based on this information,
                            the teacher will be able to determine the learning outcomes and the objectives of the
                            course. A useful resource in this phase is a placement test that will determine the skills
                            to be developed and the needs of each student. Such skills should be carefully coordinated,
                            and not randomly picked, they should be based on insights drawn not only from language
                            pedagogy but also from psychology and sociology.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"
                                style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the curriculum should be developed organically: after the teacher has determined
                            the level of the students, he will have to constantly adapt the course materials according
                            to the development of the course, gauging the students’ interests and their skills. The
                            difficulty level of the materials should be suitable for all students in the classroom;
                            materials that are too easy will bore the students, while if they are too challenging the
                            will outright hamper the carrying out of the class. These materials should also be tailored
                            to the capacity of the teachers who will be leading the course. This why we stress the
                            importance of a hands-on curriculum, which employs real-life situations and not a bookish
                            language which is detached from the students' daily speech.</p>

                        <p>Thirdly, the curriculum should not be too long, so as to not bore the students. Classroom
                            activities should be collaborative and engaging.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"

                        <p>Fourthly, the curriculum should be based on a book for the student and a guide for the
                            teacher, that will help him in implementing the program. Such a program should contemplate
                            clear answers to what is being learned and why. What exactly am I offering the students in
                            this course and why am I offering it?&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Our academic researcher, <a href="/pages/view/our-teachers">Mr. Mortada</a> has
                            studied for 4 years teaching methodologies and pedagogy at the Faculty of Education at the
                            University of Al-Minya. He has&nbsp; attended numerous workshops and seminars which focused
                            on issues such as curriculum preparation, programs for the elementary and high school levels
                            in Egypt. He has&nbsp; also organized a conference on this subject entitled
                            “<strong>Perspectives on teaching Arabic heritage students in Turkey: challenges and
                                solutions</strong>”. The conference was held in Istanbul in October 2017. For it, He
                            has&nbsp; obtained a formal acknowledgment from the World Union of Arabic and Islamic
                            Schools, which attests to my efforts in organizing this conference.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Arabic learning must contemplate four main skills: reading, writing, oral expression, and
                            understanding. There is furthermore another important skill that we recently added to these
                            four, and that is thinking in Arabic. A student who learns writing will necessarily develop
                            his reading and vice versa. On the other hand, there is no benefit for a student is learning
                            only how to read and write, while being incapable of speaking correctly and expressing
                            himself. Students would be able to interact with the language they are learning, and that
                            means that they are able to understand it and think in Arabic . Every skill is necessarily
                            related to the other four, and developing one will necessarily benefit the others. The
                            ultimate objective of our&nbsp; teaching method is therefore that students acquire the
                            necessary skills to express themselves, orally and in writing, and that they become able to
                            understand the language and to think in Arabic.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>Lesson Planning and Teaching</h2>
                        <p>Preparing the class is among the most important aspects that will ensure successful teaching.
                            Class preparation must be commensurate to the language level of the students. The kind of
                            classroom activities the teacher carries out is not fixed in stone: it is determined by the
                            level of the students.</p>
                        <p>Their level will also determine the kind of teaching method to be adopted in the classroom.
                            Let us say, for example, that we have some beginner students according to the ACTFL
                            criteria. This kind of students studied Arabic for 40 to 90 hours approximately. They
                            understand simple expressions and short compound sentences. They can interact with others
                            only in a limited fashion and on basic topics.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"
                                style="text-align: center;"></p>
                        <p>Our job as&nbsp; teachers begins with drawing a plan&nbsp; and deciding our steps from the
                            moment we enter the class.</p>
                        <p>We rely on video materials that will help introduce my students to the topics treated in each
                            class, through programs such as PowerPoint. we, for instance, send these materials to the
                            students before class, via email. This way, the student will have a chance to become
                            acquainted with class materials at home at his convenience and to come better prepared to
                            class. This strategy will also enable teacher and students to make the most effective use of
                            time in the classroom and students will be free to practice with classroom materials such as
                            grammar and texts at their own pace.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The class begins with the greetings and with a clear opening that addresses the class
                            contents, such as a small story or the explanation of a concept, then we should proceed with
                            recalling the materials covered in the previous class and tying them with what will be
                            covered in class on that day. This portion of the class should not exceed 5 minutes.&nbsp;
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"
                                style="text-align: center;"></p>
                        <p>There follows the presentation of the lesson and the topic of the class, which should not
                            exceed 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"
                                style="text-align: center;"></p>
                        <p>The following step is hands-on practice through classroom activities related to the topic at
                            hand. At the beginner level, we like to focus on role-play activities such as the students
                            playing grocers, or sellers or buyers. we ask them to describe some of their products,
                            according to what the students have learned in previous classes. Students then exchange
                            roles and practice in different situations and contexts. This part should last about 15
                            minutes.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Finally, there is the question and answer portion, and the closing of the class which should
                            last about 5 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"
                                style="text-align: center;"></p>
                        <p>As for reading in class, we usually like to begin with the more proficient students and move
                            on to the less proficient. For beginners students, we usually break the text in small parts
                            and read them aloud having the students repeating after us, before embarking on reading on
                            their own. We also make consistent use of the blackboard at this beginner level, mixing an
                            element of entertainment and fun with education. We have for example used the
                            “<strong>puppet theatre</strong>” as a way to entertain students while being exposed to
                            continuous use of Arabic (at least 15 minutes).&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img height="60" alt="" src="/css/images/section_sep.png"
                                style="text-align: center;"></p>
                        <p>There should be ample time left for the question and answer in order to ensure that all
                            students have grasped the lesson and that we are teaching according to the appropriate level
                            (10 minutes).</p>
